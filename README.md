## Project: Football Data Cleaning and Transformation

### Overview
This project focuses on cleaning, transforming, and analyzing raw football data. The primary dataset used for this project is `fifa21_raw_data.csv`, which contains player-related information, likely including attributes such as skill ratings, physical characteristics, and other relevant features. The transformation and analysis steps have been implemented in a Jupyter Notebook: `Football Data Cleaning and Transforming.ipynb`.

### Short Description
This project involves cleaning and preprocessing a football player dataset to make it analysis-ready. It includes handling missing values, standardizing formats, feature engineering, and conducting exploratory data analysis to derive insights for advanced analytics.

### Objectives
The main objectives of this project are:

1. Data Cleaning: Handle missing values, remove duplicates, and standardize data formats.
2. Data Transformation: Perform feature engineering, data type conversions, and other preprocessing tasks to make the data analysis-ready.
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Gain insights into the dataset using visualizations and summary statistics.
4. Output Generation: Prepare the cleaned dataset for further analysis or machine learning tasks.

### Files Included
1. fifa21_raw_data.csv: The raw dataset containing football player data.
2. Football Data Cleaning and Transforming.ipynb: A Jupyter Notebook containing the cleaning and transformation steps with detailed explanations.

### Prerequisites
Ensure you have the following tools and libraries installed:
- Python (>=3.7)
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries:
  - pandas
  - numpy

### How to Run
1. Clone the repository or download the project files.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook `Football Data Cleaning and Transforming.ipynb`.
3. Ensure the raw dataset `fifa21_raw_data.csv` is in the same directory as the notebook.
4. Run the notebook cells sequentially to execute the data cleaning and transformation processes.

### Key Steps in the Notebook
1. Loading Data:
   - Load the raw dataset using pandas.
   - Display the initial structure of the dataset to understand its contents.

2. Data Cleaning:
   - Handle missing values by either imputing or dropping rows/columns.
   - Standardize column names and formats for consistency.
   - Remove duplicate entries to ensure data integrity.

3. Data Transformation:
   - Create new features (if required) to enrich the dataset.
   - Normalize or scale numerical data for better comparability.
   - Encode categorical variables for machine learning compatibility.

### Results
- The cleaned dataset is ready for advanced analytics or model development.
- Key insights derived from the dataset can help identify trends, outliers, and patterns in football player attributes.

### Future Work
- Expand EDA to include more complex visualizations and comparisons.
- Use the cleaned dataset to build predictive models or clustering algorithms.
- Integrate additional data sources for enriched analysis.
